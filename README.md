Introduction

EKar-Automation is an advanced mobile application testing project that leverages the power of Appium, Java, Maven, and TestNG. This project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to design the testing suite and ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability of the code. The tests validate the functionality of a mobile app by checking the user's location via pin drop, uploading four images after clicking on the pin drop, and ensuring that the user cannot proceed to the next step until four images have been uploaded.

Prerequisites:
Before executing the tests, make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

*Java 8 or later
*Maven
*Appium installed in the command line
*An Android mobile device or emulator
*Android SDK
*A preferred IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
*TestNG


Conclusion:

This project showcases the capabilities of Appium, Java, Maven, and TestNG in automating the testing of a mobile application. The OOP approach in designing the tests has several benefits including maintainability, scalability, and reusability of code. The tests provide detailed test results and reports to verify the functionality of the app, along with troubleshooting tips for common issues and errors that may arise during testing.
